  The loading routine for gif images was extracted from the gif-loader
  of the xv-package. It was rearranged, enclosed into a C++-class and
  enhanced to use extension data for some game specific features.

  Here is the copyright note, that was contained in the original loader:

| xvgif.c  -  GIF loading code for 'xv'.  Based strongly on...
|
| gif2ras.c - Converts from a Compuserve GIF (tm) image to a Sun Raster image.
